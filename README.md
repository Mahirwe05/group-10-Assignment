# 🐍 Python Assignment Report

## 📄 Overview

This assignment involves two simple but important Python programs that demonstrate core programming concepts:

* **Question 2**: Checks whether a user-entered string is a palindrome.
* **Question 3**: Combines two user-entered strings, breaks the combined result into characters, and displays them clearly.

---

## ✅ Question 2: Palindrome Checker

### 🔍 Description

A **palindrome** is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "madam", "racecar"). This program allows the user to input a string and checks whether it is a palindrome using Python string slicing.

### 💡 Features

* Takes user input using `input()`
* Uses slicing `text[::-1]` to reverse the string
* Compares original and reversed strings
* Prints a clear result

### 🧾 Sample Output

```
Enter a string to check if it's a palindrome: level
Yes, it is a palindrome.
```

## ✅ Question 3: String Combiner and Character Lister

### 🔍 Description

This program asks the user for **two input strings**, combines them into one, and then:

* Displays the combined result
* Breaks it into individual characters
* Displays the list of characters

### 💡 Features

* User input for two strings
* String concatenation
* Character iteration using a list comprehension
* Organized output showing both the full string and character list

### 🧾 Sample Output

```
Enter the first text: Hello
Enter the second text: World
Combined text: HelloWorld
List of characters from combined text: ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
Thank you for using my application 
After processing the input.
```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* String input and manipulation
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)
* String slicing (`[::-1]`)
* Functions and return values
* List comprehensions
* Clean console output formatting

## 🖥️ How to Run the Programs

1. Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed.
2. Copy each code block into a `.py` file (e.g., `palindrome_checker.py`, `string_combiner.py`)
3. Run using the terminal or any Python editor:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
